 * - You are not allowed to allocate or deallocate any slots in this function
 *   (or to call any function that does this).
 *
 * - Whether you choose to change the nodes' data members or their next
 *   members is your choice. (The autograder won't care.)
 *   Whatever you do, the header node must remain the header node,
 *   i.e. @head should still be the index of the list's header node.
 *   In other words, you are reversing all nodes starting at SLOTS[head].next.
 *
 * OPTIONAL CHALLENGE that is like an interview problem:
 * Implement this function with O(1) auxiliary space, i.e. with a constant
 * amount of local variables/space that doesn't scale with the size of the
 * list. Do this all while having the function run in linear (O(n)) time,
 * where n is the number of nodes.
